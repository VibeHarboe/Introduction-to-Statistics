## ðŸ“Š Common Business Applications

### 1. **Descriptive Analysis**

Summarize and visualize key metrics:

```sql
-- Example: Monthly revenue per region
SELECT region, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
       SUM(revenue) AS monthly_revenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region, month;
```

### 2. **Customer Behavior**

Understand purchasing trends and lifecycle:

```sql
-- Example: Average orders per user
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 3. **Experimentation (A/B Testing)**

Evaluate impact of a change:

```sql
SELECT test_group, AVG(conversion) AS conversion_rate
FROM ab_test
GROUP BY test_group;
```

### 4. **Forecasting & Planning**

Use historical data for projections:

```sql
-- Example: 3-month moving average for demand
SELECT product_id, order_month,
       AVG(units_sold) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY order_month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS demand_ma
FROM product_sales;
```

## ðŸ§  Statistical Thinking for Analysts

* Ask: "What does the data **actually** say?"
* Understand distributions and variability
* Interpret p-values and confidence intervals carefully
* Always seek to validate assumptions

> Good analysts use statistics not just to describe, but to persuade with rigor.

## âœ… Best Practices

* Use visualizations to support statistical summaries
* Combine SQL with statistical tools (Python, R) for deeper insights
* Be skeptical of outliers and spurious correlations
* Communicate results with **both** statistical accuracy and business clarity

## Summary

Statistics transforms raw data into insights that matter. It helps businesses:

* Measure what works
* Predict what comes next
* Act with confidence

Whether you're optimizing a campaign or scaling a product, statistical thinking ensures you're doing it on solid ground.
