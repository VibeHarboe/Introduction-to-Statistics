# Correlation vs. Causation in Data Analysis

One of the most common mistakes in interpreting data is assuming that **correlation implies causation**. In business, this can lead to poor decisions, misallocated resources, or false narratives.

This guide helps you distinguish between correlation and causation, understand the risks of misinterpretation, and explore how SQL and experimentation can help you validate true causal effects.

## 🔗 What Is Correlation?

Correlation is a statistical relationship between two variables. When one changes, the other tends to change in a predictable way.

### Example

* Users who purchase premium subscriptions also tend to log in more frequently.

### Measured with:

* **Pearson correlation coefficient (r)** in tools like Python, R, or Excel

### In SQL:

SQL doesn’t have a built-in `CORR()` in all databases, but PostgreSQL does:

```sql
SELECT CORR(purchase_amount, visit_count) AS correlation
FROM user_metrics;
```

> A correlation of +1 means perfect positive correlation. -1 = perfect negative. 0 = no correlation.

## 🎯 What Is Causation?

Causation implies that one event **directly influences** another.

### Example

* Launching an onboarding checklist increased user retention by 15%.

Causation requires **control** and **isolation** of variables — usually via experiments or interventions.

## ⚠️ Why Correlation ≠ Causation

| Correlated Variables              | Possible Reason                           |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ice cream sales & drownings       | Both increase in summer (confounding var) |
| Coffee consumption & productivity | Driven by workload, not causality         |
| Visits & Purchases                | May be driven by a shared campaign        |

> Don’t assume effect. Look for confounding variables, timing, and control.

## 🧪 Using Experiments to Validate Causation

Use **A/B testing** or other experiments to confirm if one action **causes** an outcome.

### SQL Setup:

```sql
SELECT group_id, COUNT(*) AS users,
       AVG(converted::int) AS conversion_rate
FROM ab_test_results
GROUP BY group_id;
```

Then use external tools (Python, R) for significance testing.

### Checklist for Causality:

* Is the change isolated?
* Was there random assignment?
* Is the sample large enough?
* Do results persist over time?

## 🧠 Business Tip: When to Act on Correlation

If you:

* Can’t run an experiment
* See a **strong, consistent, and explainable** pattern
* Have supporting evidence from other sources

Then acting on correlation **might** be valid — **with caution**.

But always ask:

* Could there be reverse causality?
* Is there a third variable?

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Treat correlation as a **signal**, not proof
* Use experiments or interventions to prove causality
* Visualize data to understand directionality
* Segment your data to spot confounders

---

## Final Thought

Correlation is a starting point. Causation is the destination. As a data analyst, your job is to question patterns, validate claims, and make sure insights lead to impact — not missteps.

Use SQL to explore and segment, and experimentation to confirm what truly moves the needle.
