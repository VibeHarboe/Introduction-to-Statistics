# Data Visualization for Statistics & SQL Projects

Visualizing data is an essential part of any analytical project. In the context of SQL and statistics, it bridges the gap between raw outputs and actionable insights. This guide compiles best practices and examples of how to visualize distributions, patterns, relationships, and business KPIs using common chart types.

## ðŸŽ¨ Why Visualizations Matter

| Use Case             | Ideal Chart Type        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Distribution         | Histogram, Boxplot      |
| Trend over Time      | Line Chart, Area Chart  |
| Category Comparisons | Bar Chart, Column Chart |
| Correlation          | Scatterplot, Heatmap    |
| Segment Breakdown    | Pie Chart, Treemap      |

## ðŸ“ˆ Plot Types Explained

### 1. **Bar & Column Charts**

Compare values across categories.

```sql
-- Revenue per region
SELECT region, SUM(revenue) AS total_rev
FROM sales
GROUP BY region;
```

Use when: Comparing discrete groups (e.g. revenue by country).

### 2. **Line Charts**

Show trends over continuous time.

```sql
-- Monthly signups
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', signup_date) AS month, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY month;
```

Use when: Tracking change over time.

### 3. **Scatterplots**

Reveal correlation between variables.

```sql
-- Plot sales vs. ad spend
SELECT ad_spend, revenue FROM marketing;
```

Use when: Exploring relationships or trends in continuous values.

### 4. **Boxplots**

Summarize distribution, highlight outliers.

Helpful when comparing spread and detecting anomalies.

## ðŸ”¥ Outliers & Heatmaps

### Outliers (Boxplot Example)

Use boxplots to find extreme values in revenue, churn, or order sizes.

```sql
-- Orders by customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

Visualize total\_spent as a boxplot to detect high spenders.

### Heatmaps

Visualize matrix-like data (e.g., correlation or frequency).

```sql
-- Pivot sales by weekday and hour
SELECT day_of_week, hour, COUNT(*)
FROM web_sessions
GROUP BY day_of_week, hour;
```

Use heatmaps to show intensity (e.g., busiest hours).

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Visuals

### A/B Testing Conversion

```sql
-- Conversion rates
SELECT group_id, AVG(converted) AS conv_rate
FROM ab_results
GROUP BY group_id;
```

Use bar charts or confidence interval plots to communicate results.

### Funnels

Sequential step analysis:

* Visits > Product Views > Add to Cart > Checkout

## ðŸ›  Best Practices

* **Label clearly** â€“ Always include axis labels, units, and titles
* **Choose right chart** â€“ Let your message dictate the form
* **Donâ€™t clutter** â€“ Remove unnecessary gridlines or colors
* **Color with purpose** â€“ Use color to emphasize, not decorate
* **Consistency** â€“ Use consistent date formats and scales

## Summary

Visuals make your insights readable, memorable, and shareable. Whether you use SQL with Tableau, Power BI, or Python/R, remember:

> Every good analysis deserves a great chart.

Use this guide to clarify your message, spotlight your results, and elevate your data storytelling.
