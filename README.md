# 📊 Introduction to Statistics (SQL version)

This repository documents hands-on exercises, concepts, and applications from DataCamp's **"Introduction to Statistics"** course. It serves as a practical portfolio for foundational statistics, using **SQL (PostgreSQL)** to explore variability, sampling, distributions, and hypothesis testing.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop strong statistical thinking and apply core statistical tools in real-world scenarios — using only SQL — to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🧠 Skills Covered

* Understanding sampling and confidence intervals
* Measuring central tendency (mean, median, mode) using SQL aggregates
* Analyzing spread (range, IQR, standard deviation) using SQL functions
* Working with distributions using groupings and histograms
* Performing hypothesis testing using logic, filters, and proportions
* Avoiding pitfalls like correlation vs causation with structured joins

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* PostgreSQL (SQL-based statistical computation)
* Sakila database (DVD rentals)
