# 📊 Introduction to Statistics

This repository documents hands-on exercises, concepts, and applications from DataCamp's **"Introduction to Statistics"** course. It serves as a practical portfolio for foundational statistics, using Python to explore variability, sampling, distributions, and hypothesis testing.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop strong statistical thinking and apply core statistical tools in real-world scenarios, laying the foundation for data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🧠 Skills Covered

* Understanding sampling and confidence intervals
* Measuring central tendency (mean, median, mode)
* Analyzing spread (range, IQR, standard deviation)
* Working with distributions (normal, empirical)
* Hypothesis testing, p-values, significance levels
* Avoiding common pitfalls (e.g., correlation vs causation)

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* Python (via DataCamp)
* Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
